## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I The most remarkable experience in this project is working DOM manipulation. It is my first time working solo on DOM. I thought I have mastered until this project proved otherwise.

I learnt a new syntax the `nextSiblingElement` from chatGPT.

My knowledge of CSS Box Model was tested and reinforced. CSS is like a puzzle with unwritten rules. I struggled with keeping the accordion at the center.

### Continued development

I have to learn more about CSS Box Model and DOM manipulation. I also had issues importing fonts. I can't say what the problem is.
